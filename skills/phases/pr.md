# /pr

/pr creates and manages pull requests with proper title, description, and review process. Works standalone or within SDLC workflows.

**Purpose**: Create and manage pull requests for code integration

## Usage

```
/pr [base-branch]
```

**Arguments:**
- `base-branch` (optional): The base branch to compare against (default: `main`)

**Actions:**
- No argument: Create a new PR
- `status` - Check PR status
- `merge` - Merge PR (when ready)

**Examples:**
- `/pr` - Create a new pull request against main
- `/pr develop` - Create PR against develop branch
- `/pr status` - Check current PR status
- `/pr merge` - Merge the PR when approved

**Standalone Use:**
```bash
# Use anytime without SDLC workflow
/pr
/pr develop
```

**SDLC Workflow Use:**
```bash
# Part of SDLC workflow - includes review requirements
/sdlc pr
/sdlc pr status
/sdlc pr merge
```

## Commit Style Pattern

The project uses conventional commits with lowercase prefixes:

- `bugfix:` - Bug fixes
- `feat:` - New features
- `command:` - Command-related changes
- `chore:` - Chores/maintenance
- `mv:` - File/directory moves
- `doc:` - Documentation changes
- `perf:` - Performance improvements

## PR Generation Process

### 1. Fetch and Update Remote Base Branch

**Critical: Ensure you're comparing against the latest remote base**

```bash
# Fetch latest from remote to get up-to-date base branch
git fetch origin <base-branch>  # default: origin/main
```

This ensures your PR diff is accurate and not based on stale local data.

### 2. Get Commit History and Full Diff Together

**Get both commit messages and the complete diff as a unified view**

```bash
# Get commit history to understand the intent/flow
git log <base-branch>..HEAD --oneline

# Get the complete diff - this is your primary understanding source
git diff <base-branch>..HEAD

# Optional: See changed files summary
git diff <base-branch>..HEAD --stat
```

**Why both?**
- **Commit messages** tell you the *intent* and *why* changes were made
- **Full diff** shows you the *what* - actual implementation details
- **Together** they give complete context without fragmentation

Read them as a coherent whole - the commits tell the story, the diff shows the reality.

### 3. Write PR Title
- Follow commit message style: `[prefix]: [brief description]`
- Use lowercase for prefix and description
- Keep it concise (under 72 characters)
- If multiple commits with different prefixes, use the dominant one or `feat:` for features

### 4. Write PR Description
- Start with a brief summary (1-2 sentences)
- Categorize changes into **Major** and **Minor** sections
- **Major**: Core functionality, significant features, important bugfixes
- **Minor**: Small improvements, refactors, docs, trivial changes
- Use `-` for bullet points, keep descriptions concise
- Optionally include commit title in parentheses if it adds useful context
- Base the description on the unified understanding of commits + diff

### 5. Test Plan (Optional but Recommended)
- Add a checklist of testing items if applicable
- Use `- [ ]` for unchecked items
- Focus on critical paths and edge cases

## PR Output Format

```markdown
## Summary
[1-2 sentence summary of what this PR does and why]

### Major: *(optional: major title)*
- [Change description]
- [Change description]

### Minor: *(optional: minor title)*
- [Change description]
- [Change description]

## Test Plan
- [ ] [Test case 1]
- [ ] [Test case 2]
```

## PR Examples

**Input commits:**
```
feat: add user authentication
feat: add login form with validation
bugfix: fix token validation edge cases

## Best Practices

### PR Hygiene
- **Keep PRs focused**: One feature or fix per PR
- **Keep PRs small**: Easier to review and merge
- **Use draft PRs**: For work in progress
- **Reference issues**: Link to related issue numbers

### PR Communication
- **Be responsive**: Address review comments promptly
- **Be descriptive**: Explain why changes were made
- **Be respectful**: Consider all feedback
- **Document decisions**: Explain non-obvious choices

### Review Tips
- **Be thorough**: Review all changed files
- **Be constructive**: Provide helpful feedback
- **Be timely**: Review PRs promptly
- **Be clear**: Explain suggestions

### Tips
- **Always fetch remote base branch first** - Ensures accurate diff against latest code
- **Read commits and diff together as a unified view** - Commits tell intent, diff shows reality
- Group related commits logically in the description
- If the branch has many unrelated commits, suggest splitting it
- Use file paths from `git diff --stat` to be specific
- Reference related issues if applicable
