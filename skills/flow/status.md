# /sdlc status

Check and display the current SDLC workflow status.

## Guideline

This skill reads and displays the current workflow state from `.sdlc/state.json`. It shows:
1. Workflow type and title
2. Current phase and its status
3. Progress through all phases
4. Next available actions
5. Any blocked or incomplete phases

## Output Format

```markdown

Start a new workflow:
- `/sdlc start feature "New feature description"`
- `/sdlc start bugfix "Bug description"`
- `/sdlc start refactor "What to refactor"`
- `/sdlc start research "Research topic"`
```

## Detailed Phase Status

For phases with sub-steps (like test), show detailed progress:

```
test [IN PROGRESS]
├─ ✓ lint       COMPLETED  (2s, 0 errors)
├─ ✓ typecheck  COMPLETED  (5s, 0 errors)
├─ → format     RUNNING...
├─ ○ unit       PENDING
├─ ○ integ      PENDING
├─ ○ e2e        PENDING
└─ ○ coverage   PENDING
```
