# /sdlc

Software Development Lifecycle management with intelligent intent detection.

## Usage

```bash
/sdlc [natural language request]  # Smart mode - AI detects intent
/sdlc [command] [args]             # Explicit command
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Smart mode - just describe what you want
/sdlc understand the codebase       # → /sdlc understand
/sdlc fix the login bug             # → bugfix workflow
/sdlc add user authentication       # → feature workflow
/sdlc run tests                     # → /sdlc test
/sdlc commit my changes             # → /sdlc commit

# Explicit commands
/sdlc understand
/sdlc spec "Add OAuth"
/sdlc coding
/sdlc test
/sdlc commit
```

## Intent Detection

| Your Request              | Detected Action          | Creates Files?        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| "understand the codebase" | `/sdlc understand`       | ✅ Yes (arch cache)    |
| "explore payment module"  | Quick explore (no skill) | ❌ No                  |
| "how does auth work?"     | Quick explain (no skill) | ❌ No                  |
| "write a spec for auth"   | `/sdlc spec`             | ✅ Yes                 |
| "implement login"         | `/sdlc coding`           | ✅ Yes                 |
| "run tests"               | `/sdlc test`             | ❌ No                  |
| "review my changes"       | `/sdlc cr`               | ✅ Yes (review report) |
| "check for bugs"          | `/sdlc cr`               | ✅ Yes (review report) |
| "fix the login bug"       | bugfix workflow          | ✅ Yes                 |
| "add user API"            | feature workflow         | ✅ Yes                 |

> **Note**: "explore" and "how does" questions are answered directly without creating files. Use "understand" to build reusable architecture cache.
| "修复登录bug" | bugfix workflow (中文) |

## Best Practices

1. **Always start with `/sdlc understand`** - Build context and create architecture cache
2. **Always write specs with `/sdlc spec`** - Document what you're doing
3. **Use smart mode for convenience** - Let AI detect the workflow
4. **Use explicit commands for precision** - When you know exactly what phase you need

## Migration Notes

| Old Command   | New Command                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------- |
| `/spec`       | `/sdlc spec`                |
| `/git-commit` | `/commit` or `/sdlc commit` |
| `/codereview` | `/sdlc cr`                  |

**`/commit` and `/pr` are now standalone** - use anytime without starting an SDLC workflow.

# Internal: Intent Detection & Routing

> This section is for model execution. The simplified documentation above is for users.

## Intent Detection Process

When `/sdlc` is invoked with arbitrary input:

1. **Check for explicit commands first**
   - If input matches `understand|spec|coding|test|verify|commit|pr|debug|research|cr|secure`
   - Execute the corresponding phase skill directly

2. **Analyze for workflow-level intents**
   - Bug fix: `fix|bug|issue|error|problem|修复|调试`
   - Feature: `add|new feature|implement|feature|添加|新功能|实现`
   - Refactor: `refactor|clean up|restructure|重构`

3. **Analyze for phase-level intents**
   - Understand (creates architecture cache): `understand|analyze architecture|map codebase|build context|create arch cache`
   - Explore/Read (lightweight, no cache): `explore|show me|how does|explain|walk through|what is|read code`
   - Review/CR (finds issues): `review|check|audit|assess|inspect|find issues|find problems|look for bugs|审查|检查`
   - Spec: `spec|specification|document requirements|write spec|规范|规格|文档`
   - Research: `research|investigate|compare|best practices|研究|调研|比较`
   - Coding: `implement|code|write|build|create|develop|实现|编写|开发`
   - Test: `test|run tests|verify|check|validate|测试|运行测试`
   - Commit: `commit|save changes|提交|保存`
   - PR: `pull request|pr|submit|提交pr`

4. **Extract context**
   - Git status (uncommitted changes?)
   - Current branch name
   - Active workflow state
   - Recent specs

5. **Route and execute**
   - Show detected intent
   - Execute appropriate skill or workflow

## Routing Map

```python
# Pseudo-code for routing
if is_explicit_command(input):
    execute_phase_skill(input)
elif has_bugfix_intent(input):
    execute_workflow('bugfix', extract_description(input))
elif has_feature_intent(input):
    execute_workflow('feature', extract_description(input))
elif has_refactor_intent(input):
    execute_workflow('refactor', extract_description(input))
else:
    # Phase-level intents
    intent = detect_phase_intent(input)
    if intent:
        execute_phase_skill(intent)
    else:
        ask_for_clarification()
```

## Skill Invocations

When routing to a specific phase, invoke:
- `/sdlc understand` → read `skills/phases/understand.md`
- `/sdlc cr` → read `skills/phases/cr.md`
- `/sdlc spec` → read `skills/phases/spec.md`
- `/sdlc coding` → read `skills/phases/coding.md`
- `/sdlc test` → read `skills/phases/test.md`
- `/sdlc commit` → read `skills/phases/commit.md`
- `/sdlc pr` → read `skills/phases/pr.md`

When routing to a workflow, invoke:
- bugfix → read `skills/workflows/bugfix.md`
- feature → read `skills/workflows/feature.md`
- refactor → read `skills/workflows/refactor.md`
- research → read `skills/workflows/research.md`

## Skill Behavior Summary

| Skill          | Creates Files                            | Purpose                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `understand`   | ✅ Yes (`.sdlc/docs/arch/`, `.sdlc/docs/understand/`) | Architecture cache, reusable documentation |
| `cr`           | ✅ Yes (`.sdlc/docs/cr/`)                 | Code review report with findings           |
| `explore/read` | ❌ No                                     | Quick inspection, no artifacts             |

### When to use which

- **User says "explore/show me/how does/explain/walk through"** → Just read and explain, **do not** invoke understand skill
  - This is a lightweight conversation, no artifacts needed
  - Just use Read/Glob tools and explain

- **User says "understand/analyze architecture/map codebase/build context"** → Invoke `/sdlc understand`
  - Creates architecture cache in `.sdlc/docs/arch/`
  - Generates understanding report in `.sdlc/docs/understand/`
  - For reuse across multiple tasks

- **User says "review/check/audit/assess/find issues"** → Invoke `/sdlc cr`
  - Creates code review report in `.sdlc/docs/cr/`
  - Finds bugs, security issues, quality problems

## Context Extraction

```bash
# Get git status
git_status=$(git status --porcelain)

# Get current branch
current_branch=$(git branch --show-current)

# Check for active workflow
if [ -f .sdlc/state.json ]; then
    active_workflow=$(jq -r '.workflow' .sdlc/state.json)
    current_phase=$(jq -r '.phase' .sdlc/state.json)
fi

# Get latest spec
latest_spec=$(find .sdlc/docs/spec -name "*.md" -type f -printf '%T@ %p\n' | sort -n | tail -1 | cut -f2- -d" ")
```

## Execution Feedback

Always show what was detected before executing:

```
🎯 Detected intent: <intent>
📋 Scope: <extracted_scope>
→ Executing: <command or workflow>
```
